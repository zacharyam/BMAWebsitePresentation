            <h1>Strategic Goals</h1>
            <p><a href="index.html">HOME</a></p>
            <h3>One</h3>
            <p class="sub">An Immediate Approach.</p>
            <p>A</p>
            <p>Utilizing video content as a method of outreach for the DSO's engagement. This includes Instagram Story reels and TikTok, where the reach is rewarded with quick growth for higher quality productions. The other side of this is that this helps bring reach to younger audiences with any media format relating to the 'Seconds-Long' media style (Vine, TikTok, Instagram Reels, Netflix Fast Videos).</p>
            <p>B</p>
            <p>YouTube live: In its' parent corporation, Google, Youtube's recommendation system and Google Ad service give wide reach over geographical and categorized demographics. In this manner, the growth from livestreaming via YouTube has created a two-fold reach: one in the fact that Google's keyword services provide discoverability, and the livestreaming aspect bringing new traffic from many different external points of entry. While the DSO then does maintain it's own livestreaming services, without the increased discoverability, the DSO's initial intention of increasing ticket revenue is limited in it's opportunity cost.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Two</h3>
            <p class="sub">Within 6 Months to a Year.</p>
            <p>A</p>
            <p>Google Ad services provide a mid-term solution in the sense that prolonged advertisements gives consistent exposure through video content. This could provide the DSO two things: advertisements through blogs (particularly for those searching up any music related things such as instrument rentals, to just living in the Greater Detroit area), to Youtube ads.</p>
            <p>B</p>
            <p>While the particular idea sits within the topic of finances, any physical media utilizing the DSO's logo can be a form of marketing by association. Currently, the DSO does not have any form of merchandise, such as clothing and accessories. With their modernized logo, the DSO could experiment in using the logo as an asset for branding. This generates revenue, as well, and can be used on online and physical platorms.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Three</h3>
            <p class="sub">Within the next 3 years.</p>
            <p>Season tickets and patron benefits add a layer of exlusitivity for revenue. An estimate of consistent branding for season tickets, discounts, and further marketing with consistent exposure to consumers might yield benefits for long-standing members. Essentially, rewarding long-time consumers might bring about benefits for buyers to consistently see the DSO.</p>

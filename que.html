            <h5><i>How is the DSO branding?</i></h5>
            <p>The DSO is prioritizing a goal of accessibility, and this can be shown through their social media and livestreaming efforts. Everything from their Twitter bio: "The most accessible orchestra on the planet." to their livestreams which broadcasted performances freely from their landing page / website.</p>
            <h5><i>What are their efforts to become less stuffy?</i></h5>
            <p>The DSO establishes a sense of security by a few things: one, a lack of formal dress code and promotion of formal-casual to casual clothing. While this is standard practices for some, the goal here is that less attention is brought to this more than anything. Two, free livestreaming events also take away the pressure of being overtly formal to an event, and allow viewers to view the performance without understanding the social cues of when to applaud a performance. What is also interesting is the lack of 'orchestral' visuals where instead of featuring the whole ensemble the visuals are more representative of 'free art' photographic styles and designs that emphasize communal events rather than an established formality.</p>

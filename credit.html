            <p>The two main threads for which the DSO could focus towards is trust and transperancy. Constantly omitting information regarding the DSO to the public, as was in the past, doesn't inform a sense of security within the community.</p>
            <p>Trust establishes communal connections within the DSO's reputation as well. Having the Greater Detroit area know the DSO as being a commonplace, or being recreational rather than formal has benefits for building a strong audience. For example, my friends (non-music majors) who offer me tickets to the DSO brings me more incentive to go to the DSO and watch performances, but for this to happen my friends would need to trust in their experience prior to attending.</p>
